A socket is an endpoint for communication between machines over a network.
Think of it like a phone line - when you want to communicate between two computers,
each computer needs a socket (like each person needs a phone),
and they use these sockets to send and receive data.

``cpp
	int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```

"
	domain: Specifies the communication domain

	AF_INET: IPv4 Internet protocols
	AF_INET6: IPv6 Internet protocols
	AF_UNIX: Local communication


	type: Specifies the communication type

	SOCK_STREAM: TCP (reliable, ordered, connection-based)
	SOCK_DGRAM: UDP (unreliable, unordered, connectionless)


	protocol: Usually 0 (system picks appropriate protocol)
